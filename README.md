# What is this project

This project is a website that hosts my Resumes and Portfolios so people can interact with my work a little more than the average resume.

## What is the purpose of this project

Well, this project serves two functions.  The first is a resume that is a little more crafted and currated than what I can traditionally fit on a one-page pdf.  The second function is to prove that I do know (at least) the basics of full stack development.

### Well that is kind of cool.  Done before but still interesting.

I am not trying to blow any minds here.  Just trying to show and share my knowledge (hence why its publicly accessable).

### Is there anything else that you want us to know

I mean, sure.  I like Rock Climbing and Long Walks on the Beach.  Idk.

As for the Website, it is programmed mostly using React, Typescript and Sass.  I do know javascript but I find that Typescript helps me create much cleaner code than javascript can do by itself.  Luckily typescript is transpiled into javascript so it is the same at runtime and (although I am still learning and understanding this) it only takes removing the forced types in typescript to completely convert typescript to javascript.

Sass is used because I like the very basic but very useful ability to call variables in a clean way. (Native CSS variable are always gross looking) but otherwise it is used the exact same as CSS.  This site also uses a whole lot of CSS that didnt really need the additional functionality of scss.

### What about the blog "Coming Soon"? When will that be up?

This site as a whole is a work in progress.  The blog is WAY far on the backlog so it will be coming soon for a long time.  (So maybe coming no-so-soon would be more accurate).  The idea is the blog will contain personal projects that will show parts of my skillsets/knowledge that wouldn't make sense on a resume.  

### Where do I go if I want to know more about you

Ummm...great question.  Maybe linkedin?  I will eventually have a way to contact me either on this page or somewhere else but I want to ensure that my information is not super public so that I dont get spammed all the time before I share anything.
