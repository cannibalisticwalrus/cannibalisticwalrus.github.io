# What is this project

This project is a website that hosts my Resumes and Portfolios so people can interact with my work a little more than the average resume.

## What is the purpose of this project

Well, this project serves two functions.  The first is a resume that is a little more crafted and currated than what I can traditionally fit on a one-page pdf.  The second function is to prove that I do know (at least) the basics of full stack development (although at the moment it only proves Front-End Development).

### Well that is kind of cool.  Done before but still interesting.

I am not trying to blow any minds here.  Just trying to show and share my knowledge (hence why its publicly accessable).

### Is there anything else that you want us to know

I mean, sure.  I like Rock Climbing and Long Walks on the Beach.  Idk.

As for the Website, it is programmed mostly using React, Typescript and Sass.  I do know javascript but I find that Typescript helps me create much cleaner code than javascript can do by itself.  Luckily typescript is transpiled into javascript so it is the same at runtime and (although I am still learning and understanding this) it only takes removing the forced types in typescript to completely convert typescript to javascript.

Sass is used because...well because it is just a better evolution of CSS but not as frameworky as Emotion or other stylers.  As a result, it is a lot easier for me to read, understand and work with.

### Where do I go if I want to know more about you

Feel free to visit the site and use any of the contact me options.  

### Can I use this site as a base for my own?
Sure. I would be lying if I didn't build this site (loosly) off of a few great portfolio sites.
All I ask is that you give me credit and don't pass my style/personality/resume/achievments off as your own.  Fill it out with your own cool stuff.
